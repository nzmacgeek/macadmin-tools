# macadmin-tools
*A place to share some of the scripts I use in my work as a Mac Systems Engineer.*

In my work environment, I manage a mid-sized Casper managed OS X and iOS fleet (~2000 Macs). I work with one other colleague to build packages and configurations to deploy to many different departments in the organisation. In my time doing this, I've developed scripts and other tools that I use to make my life easier. This repo is just an attempt at sharing some of my work so that others may adapt it for their use if they require.

All scripts are licensed under an MIT license. As a further disclaimer, all opinions/other things I create here are not necessarily those of my employer. I'm just sharing for the good will of our sysadmin community.

Go well.
